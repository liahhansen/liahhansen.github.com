title: Voicenotes - My First Twilio App
---
{{ page.title }}
================

Sometimes I wonder about my sanity when I voluntarily spend a sunny Saturday in a basement writing code. Yesterday was one of those days at the Social App Workshop held at Heroku's new headquarters.  The morning was an action packed string of talks from engineers at Twitter, Twilio, Facebook, Apigee and Heroku.  I was really impressed with Jeff's talk about Twilio and thought I'd try making an app with it's api.

The results of my efforts are here: [http://voicenotes.heroku.com/voice_to_text](http://voicenotes.heroku.com/voice_to_text)

My goal was to write an app that you could call, record a message, and the message would be transcribed and put on a webpage. The transcribe feature is pretty inaccurate.  I left a voicenote of 'Remember to take out the trash' and it transcribed it as 'Remember to take out the plan'.  It got 'two laundry' when I said 'do laundry'.  But still, Twilio is a very cool idea and it got my creative juices flowing.
