================

I've been using git since I started learning Ruby in July 2009.  I've gone through many of the more advanced topics - creating branches, checking them out & merging them is clear to me...that is until it isn't clear.  Sometimes git does things I'm not expecting.  So, I figured I'd host a little hands-on workshop to try to work out git intricacies.  There is nothing like teaching a topic to learn it inside & out.
