================

Eric Mill gave an inspiring talk at Golden Gate Ruby Conference. Below are my notes about it.

Innovative websites written in Rails and based off of open government data:
 
* http://datasf.org/showcase/
* http://www.nyc.gov/html/datamine/html/home/home.shtml
* http://data.dc.gov/
* http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/
* http://www.data.gov/
* http://flyontime.us/
* http://usaspending.gov/
* http://sunlightfoundation.com/clearspending/
* http://www.thomas.gov/
* http://www.govtrack.us/ -- scrapes thomas
* http://www.opencongress.org/ -- built off of govtrack.us, rails app
  * inspired congress to publish votes in xml
  * senate also puts out info in xml
  * no where near all 50 states give out info
* sunlight is trying to make state apis the norm
  * mongo db is necessary for it - like some states have only one house, not two

Federal Register - one of the more important publications of the government

* rulemaking
* public notices
* chances to comment
* published by the office of the public register

http://www.govpulse.us/ was one result of a contest - open source rails app on github, EC2

* it shows what is going on in your area
* government contacted them and contracted the develpers
* ditched some red tape
* pushedthem to take risks
* buy-in from the top of the agency
*  made something happen in 3 months...much faster than most gov projects
* they cut their hours by 40% at regular jobs
* result of their work: http://www.federalregister.gov/

Gov is seeing devs as their customers

America

* first country to have a freedom of information act
* all govs info is in the public domain
* we have the freedom to set amazing examples - what we do matters - talk to other people

2010 census - machine readable, but have to get through 300 pages of pdf instructions - people have written ruby libraries around the data.
